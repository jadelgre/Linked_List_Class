Linked List is a C++ class which stores integer values dynamically. Linked List uses the included node class.


Linked list functions include:

size(): returns the number of elements stored in the list.

get(int position): returns the element stored at index value position. If position is outside the bounds of the list 0 is returned.

add(int n): add element n to the end of the list.

insert(int n, int position): insert element n into the list before index value of position passed to it.

erase(int position): erase the element stored at index value position from the list.

The copy and assignment constructors for list objects have been completed.
